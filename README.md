# plugin.video.tv-gab

Welcome to my TV.GAB addon for KODI. This add-on allows you to view streams and replay on the https://tv.gab.com streaming site.

I hope you get some use out of it. Feel free to feedback any suggestions and/or code improvements.

Please note: this is an early version. It has no support for user login. It just reads the "guide" page and allows you to watch the videos there.
Instructions:

## Disclaimer

It's yours. If you break it, you can keep the pieces. If you want to add stuff feel free. You just need to follow the GPL and make your improvements available to others.

## Support
Like KODI, this add-in code is free and will remain so. If you'd like to support work on it, then it would be appreciated. Throw a few satoshis (Bitcoin) to:
